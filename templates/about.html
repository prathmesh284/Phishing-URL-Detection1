        <h2>About Phishing</h2>
        <p>
          Phishing is a type of cybercrime where attackers impersonate
          legitimate organizations or individuals through emails, messages,
          websites, or other digital communication. Their goal is to deceive
          people into revealing sensitive information such as passwords, credit
          card numbers, or personal data.
        </p>

        <h3>üîé How Phishing Works</h3>
        <ul style="text-align: left">
          <li>
            <strong>Fake Emails or Messages:</strong> The attacker sends
            messages that appear to come from trusted sources like banks, social
            networks, or government bodies.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Malicious Links:</strong> These messages often contain links
            that lead to fake websites designed to steal your data.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Urgency and Fear:</strong> Phishing messages create a sense
            of urgency (e.g., "Your account will be closed!") to make victims
            act quickly without thinking.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>‚ö†Ô∏è Common Signs of Phishing</h3>
        <ul style="text-align: left">
          <li>Unexpected requests for personal or financial information.</li>
          <li>
            Suspicious URLs or misspelled domains (e.g.,
            <code>paypa1.com</code> instead of <code>paypal.com</code>).
          </li>
          <li>Poor grammar, spelling mistakes, or unprofessional design.</li>
          <li>
            Emails that address you generically ("Dear Customer" instead of your
            name).
          </li>
        </ul>
